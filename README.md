I am Anukalp Parihar, a Business Analyst at Grant Thornton with a B.Tech in CSE and 2 years of professional experience, backed by a foundation in full-stack development (MERN).

My expertise spans requirement analysis, process optimization, and solution implementation, enabling organizations to improve efficiency and deliver business value. I collaborate closely with both technical teams and stakeholders to gather requirements, streamline workflows, test systems, and ensure seamless solution delivery.

With hands-on experience in Salesforce CRM, API testing, and data analysis, I bring a developerâ€™s mindset to business analysisâ€”bridging the gap between business needs and technical execution.

Passionate about innovation and continuous improvement, I strive to build scalable, user-centric solutions that make a measurable impact.
